          <p>The perfect fried chicken sandwich exists! If you’re from SoCal, you have almost certainly heard of the legendary
Howlin’ Ray’s. The wait used to take at least an hour, and we are not the biggest fans of waiting that long for food.
As of June 2021, you <del>are able to</del> <em>must</em> pay a bunch of Postmates fees to get it delivered, presumably to a random
parking lot in Chinatown if you live outside the actual delivery area. For us, it was worth the extra fees to avoid
waiting in line.</p>

<p>The sandwich comes with the perfect piece of fried chicken: a sizable - but not too big! - piece of juicy chicken
breast. How they keep such a thick chunk of white meat so juicy is beyond us! We think the magic is in the breading,
which has some sort of magic <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. The sandwich comes with a sweet and tangy slaw with onions, comeback
sauce, and pickles. The spice level goes from <em>Country</em> (without spice) to <em>Howlin</em> (super spicy). We’d go for <em>Medium</em>
if you want a spicy sandwich and <em>Medium Plus</em> if you want it a little spicier. In our experience, anything above that
and the heat overpowers your enjoyment of your sandwich.</p>

<p>Grab a side of shake fries, and you have the perfect fried chicken sandwich meal.</p>
