Obviously you should get it on a bun - which is the most delicious, fluffy, and
buttery brioche. The piece of dark meat chicken itself is perfectly crispy and
juicy. While the chicken is really good, what takes this sandwich over the top
is that amazing fry sauce which is simultaneously creamy and peppery. This is
the same sauce that they put on their cottage fries which are basically deep
fried crunchy potato slices. Grab a puffy cottage fry as the perfect vessel to
scoop extra sauce.</p>

<p>Located in Irvine’s Trade Food Hall, a sandwich from Two Birds can perfectly be
paired with a fresh pint from Center Hub situated next door. Overall this has to
be one of the best fried chicken sandwiches we’ve had.</p>
