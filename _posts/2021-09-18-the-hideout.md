The Hideout is a small American restaurant in the woods of Aptos. In the Sandwich & Burger section of their menu is a
fried chicken sandwich. It's a basic sandwich with slaw, pickle slices, a chipotle aioli. While the potato bun was
pretty good, the chicken piece was disappointing - small and not very crispy. Overall, the sandwich was slightly on the
dry side and not particularly memorable.

They have fantastic truffle fries with parmesan though, so get some of that and pair it with their spicy aioli or some
ranch dressing.
