Besides the sandwich at [The Table]({% post_url 2019-12-07-the-table %}), this might be the largest one we had so far.
It was so large, it broke apart while eating. I also didn’t feel great afterwards because it was so much food. The
chicken was good and juicy, with a nice crisp on the outside. On the list of negative points, the sauce on the sandwich
didn’t have much flavor and there was just wayyy too much lettuce on this sandwich. Like cheap iceberg lettuce, nothing
fancy. But on the upside, they have this amazing thick bacon that you should add on your chicken sandwich. Or order it
as a side. The bacon rescued this mediocre chicken sandwich.
