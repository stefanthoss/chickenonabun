The fried chicken in this sandwich is absolutely massive - it would be enough
for 3 sandwiches in fact. The flavor of the chicken is a bit lacking and we
definitely could've used more of the slaw, which is unfortunate because the bun
is the best we had on a chicken sandwich in a while. The healthy side salad will
make you feel a bit better after you consumed an entire chicken. Overall a bit
dissapointing for an otherwise excellent brunch venue.
