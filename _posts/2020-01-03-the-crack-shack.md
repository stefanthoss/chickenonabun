This restaurant has it all - a casual space to sit, friendly employees, cornhole, a good draft beer selection, and of
course amazing fried chicken. The *Firebird* (see picture) has the right level of spicyness, fried onions, and ranch
dressing on top of perfect juicy chicken.

But it doesn't stop there, you can also order the *Hangover* which is served on the perfect soft biscuit with a fried
egg. No matter which of the fried chicken sandwiches you order, share a large order of fries and try all the sauces that
they offer at their self-service station. As with any joint with San Diego origins, expect an awesome beer list so you
can wash down your sandwich and fries with a nice cold brew.
