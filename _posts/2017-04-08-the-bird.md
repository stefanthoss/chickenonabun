One of the best fried chicken sandwiches we ever had. The sandwich comes with pickles, an apple slaw, and mayo. You have
the choice between a regular sandwich and the spicy one, which is smothered in a Nashville-style sauce. As a side, you
have to get their curly fries - either regular or loaded with bacon and cheese.

If you come here during breakfast, you should also try the chicken biscuit. You'll get the same fried chicken on a
fluffy biscuit with crispy hash browns.
