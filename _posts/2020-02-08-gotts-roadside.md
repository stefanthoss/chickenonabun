Gott's *Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich* is on the lighter side and tastes almost healthy. Almost. Together with the arugula,
pickled cucumbers and turnip, and the fluffy brioche bun (which has sesame on *both* sides), the sandwich doesn't weigh
you down. Still, that juicy piece of chicken won't let you forget that you're eating fried chicken.

If you're at the San Francisco location and happen to catch a sunny day in the city, grab a local beer from the bar and
enjoy your chicken sandwich on the nice outdoor patio at the Ferry Building.
