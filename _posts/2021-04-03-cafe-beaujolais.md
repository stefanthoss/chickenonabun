Café Beaujolais is an amazing restaurant in Mendocino. During the pandemic, they started offering take-out food instead
of their usual fine dining French cuisine. One of these new take-out items is the *Buttermilk Fried Nashville Hot
Chicken Sandwich*. The sandwich is not bad and pretty basic with fried chicken, onions, pickles, cheese, lettuce, and
tomato. The bun is great, but the chicken was a bit greasy albeit juicy. The hot sauce on the chicken was not as spicy
as expected and seemed to be lightly applied with a mop rather than a proper dip into a sauce bath, resulting in very
little sauce. We will continue to come back for Café Beaujolais's regular menu and delicious wood-fired pizzas, but
we'll skip the chicken sandwich next time.
