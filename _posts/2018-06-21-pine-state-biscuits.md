The biscuit is tender. The chicken is crispy. The gravy is smooth and flavorful.
Doesn't matter whether you come here because you're a fan of biscuits or you
like chickens on buns - you order _The Reggie_. There might be a wait, but this
is the perfect breakfast. Especially when the amazing pecan pie is the seasonal
pie, which you must get (with whipped cream, of course).
