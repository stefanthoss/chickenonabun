The highlight of this fried chicken sandwich is the fresh bread, the French roll is crusty on the outside and chewy on
the inside. Unfortunately there's not a thick slab of chicken on this sandwich, the buttermilk chicken is not bad but
small and a bit on the dry side. Still, the spicy coleslaw makes up for it with the perfect amount of spiciness and
crunch.

We also have to talk about the potato puffs. If you're not coming here for the chicken sandwich, you should for the
potatoes. Just like the French roll, they're crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. And don't forget to get the
creamy truffle sauce to dip 'em in.

If you like chicken sandwiches, you have to try this when you're in Berkeley! Grab it to go and enjoy it somewhere on
the UC Berkeley campus.
