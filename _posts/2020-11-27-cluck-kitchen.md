Orange County might have a new best fried chicken sandwich spot - that crown belonged to
[Two Birds]({% post_url 2020-02-02-two-birds %}) in the past but Cluck Kitchen is up there.

The chicken pieces are thick, juicy, perfectly fried, and large. You have the choice of three flavor combinations:
There's the *Classic* sandwich with lettuce and mayo. Boring? NO WAY! It's juicy and stands on its own - no spice or
sauce needed to level up the flavor. You can also get the *Nashville Hot* that smothered with plenty of Nashville hot
sauce and topped with slaw and pickles. This sandwich is very flavorful and the choice for any spice lover. Be warned
with the heat levels though - you can choose between Mild, Medium, Hot, Extra Hot, and Get Clucked (offered as an option
from 1-5). We got the Hot sandwich and it was already really spicy. They also have a *Havarti Hen* with cheese and
sundried tomatoes, which we didn't try this time but are keen to check out next time.

In terms of sides there are a few options but keep it simple and just a get curly fries. A single portion of fries is
absolutely massive and is best shared between friends. It came out piping hot and fresh, which is just hos we like our
fries. There are a few sauce options in case you think ketchup is too boring, we can recommend the *Cluck Sauce* which
is a honey-mustardy mayo.
