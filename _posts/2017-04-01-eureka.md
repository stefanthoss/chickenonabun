The fried chicken sliders come in pairs of two and are topped with mashed potatoes for the ultimate carb-load. The
chicken is very juicy and the slightly spicy sauce on the sliders gives them the perfect kick.

**Update April 2022:** They now also have a proper fried chicken sandwich in addition to the sliders (see photo). The
chicken comes with very thick and flavorful breading and is a solid alternative to their excellent variety of burgers.
But stay away from the truffle cheese fries, they often come cold and soggy and desperately lacking in flavor.
