Surf City Sandwich is a great sandwich spot with plenty of flavorful and interesting sandwiches. Most importantly, they
have a fried chicken sandwich called the *Chicken Cowabunga*. The chicken sandwich is pretty good although it falls a
bit short compared to their other sandwiches.

The fried chicken breast is not the most flavorful but relatively juicy and stayed surprisingly crisp even after the
drive home. The sandwich also comes with a slice of American cheese, lots of pretty good pickles, a spicy mayo, and
caramelized onions. There are a bit too many of the overly sweet caramelized onions for our taste, so the sandwich is
sweeter than it should be. Overall, it feels a bit like an elevated and improved version of the
[Popeyes sandwich]({% post_url 2020-04-10-popeyes %}) - although the chicken piece itself at Popeyes is slightly better.

The sandwich comes with excellent house-made potato chips on the side. But if you want to get push your sandwich
experience over the edge, order the Beer Barnacles as a side. Beer Barnacles consists of a large heap of tater tots with
bacon bits and a habanero cheese sauce on top. The sauce fluctuates day-to-day in spiciness, so be warned it can range
from medium hot to HOT! Share them with one or two friends since the portion is kinda big.
