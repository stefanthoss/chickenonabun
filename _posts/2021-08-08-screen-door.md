We can be a little skeptical when there’s a significant wait for any restaurant - after all, that’s how they always get
you, right? With an hour long wait and swarms of people waiting outside? Nonetheless, our brunch experience at the
Screen Door in Portland did not disappoint. 

The fried chicken sandwich was perfection, sizable yet not too big, striking a delicate balance with a large piece of
crispy chicken, a heap of creamy slaw, and a light and fresh bun. The sandwich was not spicy yet delivered big flavor.
With a menu for fried chicken and non-fried chicken lovers (do these people exist???) alike, this place is definitely
worth the stop if you’re ever in town.
