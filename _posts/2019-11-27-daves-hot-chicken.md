They call them sliders but they're big sandwiches. Very juicy chicken and a flavorful sauce. Medium spiciness is not
very spicy, so go at least one step above it if you like it hot. The pickles give the sandwich the perfect tang and
compensate for the boring bun. Come here with somebody you love and share the combo #2 that has two "sliders".
