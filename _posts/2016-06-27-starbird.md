Starbird's chicken sandwiches are as good as their chicken tenders. The chicken is moist and has a tasty breading. What
makes the Starbird sandwiches stand out is not the chicken itself but the toppings and the bread. They have many
different styles, for example the *Starbird* with avocado, the *Hot Honey Chicken* with hot honey and sweet pepper
relish, and the *Korean Fried Chicken* with Gochujang sauce and miso slaw. The bread rolls are soft and have a great
chew. Just don't substitute the crispy chicken with grilled chicken when ordering your sandwich.

Let's talk sides: The fries at Starbird are really good with the perfect amount of crispiness. And one of the highlights
is definitely their sauce selection, especially the Gochujang-flavored Seoul Sauce. Alternatively, their super slaw made
from kale and cabbage sounds boring but is actually really good. Top the slaw with one of the small packages of Crystal
Hot Sauce that they have and you'll have the perfect spicy slaw as your side.
