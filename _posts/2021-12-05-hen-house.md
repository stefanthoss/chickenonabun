We stopped here while driving hungry through Danville, and this is a great fried chicken sandwich spot. The bun is nice
and fluffy and the meat is what it should be for a good sandwich. By default it comes with dark meat (that's what we
went for) but you can also "upgrade" to white meat for $2. Pair the sandwich with some of their tasty garlic fries and
you got yourself an excellent lunch, served to you by the friendly staff of Hen House. There were only two things to
criticize here: the chicken was slightly greasy, and the sauce was not very flavorful â€“ otherwise two enthusiastic
thumbs up!
