Dangerously spicy for those who live on the edge. We like a good spicy chicken
sandwich, but we can't even imagine getting the Fire Bird; just opt for the
Spicy Chicken Sandwich instead. Pick up some boba at Mini Monster, also in the
Anaheim Packing District, and head outside to have a chill lunch.
