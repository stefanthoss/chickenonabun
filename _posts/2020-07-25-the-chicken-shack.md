When you're travelling North on I-5 and happen to be hungry around Redding, you can stop here for some fried chicken. We had
the *Crystal Fire Chicken* which sandwiches chicken pieces between waffles. The waffle is crispy, unfortunately the chicken
is neither crispy nor juicy. This particuar style is also a bit too sour all that vinegary sauce. If you like the idea of
eating your chicken between waffles, you should travel 600 miles South along I-5 and visit
[Bruxie]({% post_url 2017-11-26-bruxie %}) in Southern California.

Alternatively you can also get a biscuit chicken sandwich. The *All-In* comes with fried chicken, bacon, and a ton of heavy gravy. The biscuit is fluffy and delicious. Overall it's good but you might regret eating the entire thing after.

If you still have room for more food, order some garlic fries. They have the perfect amont of grated garlic and parmesam.
