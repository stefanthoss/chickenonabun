The *Aunt Annie's* is the fried chicken biscuit you should order. It has the perfect combination of tanginess and
sweetness. Who would have thought that pickles and honey go so well together on fried chicken? You might think that the
honey is too sweet but it's balanced by the little sprinkle of mustard sauce. On top of that buttery biscuit this makes
the perfect fried chicken brunch.

There's also *The Sawmill* chicken biscuit with gravy and cheese instead of pickles and honey â€” but we haven't tried
this one.
