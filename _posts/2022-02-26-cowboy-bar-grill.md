The Cowboy Bar & Grill had a fried chicken sandwich as a special so we had to try it. Unfortunately it wasn't very good
and we should've stuck to one of their juicy burgers. The piece of chicken was extremely tough and dry, almost hard to
eat. The flavor was pretty good though with a spicy glaze on the chicken.
