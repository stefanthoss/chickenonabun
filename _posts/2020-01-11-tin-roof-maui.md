The spicy chicken sandwich here is very sweet. Both the bun and the sauce have a sweet and fruity Hawaiian taste to
them. The best thing about this sandwich is that they use dark chicken meat for their fried chicken. Our sandwich had
quite a bit of skin on it and was just extremely juicy - perfect together with that spicy aioli. If you want it even
spicier, down a shot of the *SLAB Hawaiian Chili Pepper Water* after your sandwich (not for the faint of heart).

On the negative side, this sandwich was served rather cold and didn't have a lot of texture. Neither the bun nor the 
chicken skin was very crispy, and everything felt rather mushy from a texture point of view.
