Famous for their greens and salads, Tender Greens also offers a fried chicken sandwich. Disappointingly though, the
chicken was not fried to order but just sitting under a warming lamp in the open kitchen area. This resulted in a
slightly dry piece of chicken with the taste being good for white chicken meat. The sandwich also comes with cabbage
slaw and pickles which balanced out the very tasty and slightly spicy chili mayo. The chili mayo was the second best
part of this sandwich, right after the fluffy and fresh brioche bun.

On the side you have many good and somewhat healthy choices. The fingerling potatoes are pretty good but definitely have
a look at their seasonal vegetables. The vegetables can be hit or miss but when we were there, they had a very tasty
medley of perfectly grilled summer squash, mushrooms, and green beans.
