Baba's Hot Chicken gets only a 4/10 from us. While the chicken piece was pretty juicy, the powder that seasoned the
chicken was not very flavorful. There was an overwhelming smokiness from the seasoning and not in a good way - think one
or two too many tablespoons of smoked paprika. Various spice levels were just different chili powders on top of the
chicken. Get the "small size" which consists of one chicken tender on the sandwich. The "normal size" has two tenders
and is simply too much chicken for the sandwich.

The two things setting this spot apart are the sauce (pretty good) and the 9/10 fries. The fries are definitely the
highlight and you should definitely get some with your sandwich.
