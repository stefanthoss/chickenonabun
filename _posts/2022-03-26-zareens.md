There are a lot of things to like about Zareen's and you should definitely visit no matter what you order. So when they
put the Crispy Chicken Tikka Sandwich on their menu, we were ecstatic. They describe it as extra crispy, extra juicy and
they're not lying. The piece of chicken is super juicy and incorporates lots of their trademark flavors. The pickles and
the sauce have a tang that pairs very well with the chicken. You can also add jalapenos and cheese on that sandwich.
While the cheese is not very exciting, we can recommend adding the jalapenos.

The only reason holding this back from a full 10 chicken score is that the bread is very sweet and mushy. But we'll be
back for this sandwich. Especially since it's paired with their amazing Masala Fries which are crispy thin fries
sprinkled with a masala spice blend.
