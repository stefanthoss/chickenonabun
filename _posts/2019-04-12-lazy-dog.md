Is it a 9 or is it a 5? This sandwich is sometimes juicy and flavorful, sometimes dry and bland. Let's settle with a 7
out of 10. In any case it's big and you won't leave hungry. It comes with a light and fresh slaw on top which lightens
the big piece of chicken perfectly. There are a lot of side options at Lazy Dog, but we prefer the traditional fries
or the lighter pickled cucumber salad.
