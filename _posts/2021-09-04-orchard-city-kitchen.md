Crispy crispy crispy! This fried chicken sandwich from the Brunch menu is crispy! We've never had such a satisfyingly
crunchy cornflake-based breading - it simply breaks apart with every bite. The sandwich came with two thin pieces of
chicken which were very juicy on the inside. The sandwich was pretty standard in terms of ingredients and well executed:
nice bun, spicy mayo, and pickle slices in addition to a juicy pickle spear on the side.
