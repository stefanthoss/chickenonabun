A Berkeley/Oakland institution. The initial impression: this sandwich is simple; it seems almost reminiscent of a
run-of-the-mill crispy chicken sandwich from any fast food spot (Wendy's, Burger King, etc.), especially the chicken
patty. However, the patty is big, juicy, and perfectly spiced. What really makes the sandwich is the unique slaw that
is heaped on the bun - spicy with thin slices of jalapenos and crisp cabbage.

Grab one of the fresh warm cookies while you're there. While we have never tried it, supposedly the strawberry
shortcake, which is only seasonably available, is amazing. We'll have to come back and see for ourselves.
