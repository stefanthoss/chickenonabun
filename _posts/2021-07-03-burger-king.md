Another worthwhile contender in the world of fast food chicken sandwiches! The hand-breaded chicken sandwiches from
Burger King are a huge step up from their original chicken sandwich (ew). They're actually so similar to the
[Popeyes sandwich]({% post_url 2020-04-10-popeyes %}) that it almost seems a disgruntled Popeyes employee secretly
passed their recipe to Burger King.

We tried the *Spicy Ch'King* (spicy glaze on the fried chicken, on the left) and the *Ch'King Deluxe* (lettuce and
tomato instead of pickles, on the right). The chicken was surprisingly thick and juicy, and the Spicy Ch'King had a
noticeable but not overpowering kick. Where it falls short of the Popeyes chicken sandwich is the crunch factor and the
bun; the breading on both Burger King sandwiches didn't manage to stay as crispy on our short drive home, and the potato
bun was a little too sweet for our taste. If there are no Popeyes around, we would pick the Burger King Ch'Kings over
other fast food chicken sandwiches.
