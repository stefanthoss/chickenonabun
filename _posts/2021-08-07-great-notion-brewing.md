While looking for a spot for dinner, we found Great Notion Brewing and figured we’d grab some beers. As luck would have
it, there is a teeny tiny food menu consisting of sandwiches. We saw the fried chicken sandwich on the menu and knew we
had to try it. 

The sandwich consists of a heaping helping of very crispy fried chicken thigh, honey garlic vinaigrette slaw, and
pickles all on a locally baked Dutch crunch roll (*swoons in Bay Area*). Not the best we’ve had, but we were pleasantly
surprised by how great it was for a brewery that offers just a few sandwiches. Unless you are very hungry, stick with
the half size.
