The Alvarado Street Brewery has not only good beers but also a *Korean Fried Chicken Sandwich* on their menu. The
sandwich sounds good but the "Korean" part of this sandwich is not very pronounced. The piece of fried chicken is
smothered in a red sauce - unfortunately it does not deliver on the Gochujang flavor we expected. The sauce is mainly
sweet and the chicken is neither Korean nor crispy. The chicken in the sandwich is also lacking a bit of
flavor. On the bright side, the slaw with carrots and lettuce works nice with the sandwich. Both the brioche bun and
the fries are pretty good as well.
