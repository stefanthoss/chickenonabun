RT Rotisserie has a lot of chicken dishes but the one to get is *Sally Hurricaneâ€™s Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich*.
Not sure whether it is actually heathier than your usual fried chicken sandwich but it definielty feels like it. They use a
delicious yoghurt sauce instead of the usual mayo which pairs well with the slaw and pickled onions. The chicken piece
is not crispy but it's juicy and flavorful.

This restaurant also shines with the sides on the menu. The *RTR Salad* is definielty a highlight with more pickled onions,
cotija cheese, and sesame vinaigrette. Unfortunately the salad also comes with a crazy amount of mint leaves which was a
bit too much. If you're not into salad, they also have really tasty and crispy fries. In the end, you maybe should get both.

The Redwood City location is a ghost kitchen with only take-out or delivery but there are two full locations in San Francisco.
