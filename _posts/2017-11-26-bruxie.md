Chicken, spicy slaw, and chili honey wrapped in a giant waffle bun. 'nuff said. Back in the day, they used to not give
you enough slaw in the sandwich and had a different recipe for the chicken, but the current version features crunchier
double-battered chicken and a heap of slaw with that sticky, addicting honey.
