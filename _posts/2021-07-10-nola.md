Nola is a great Cajun spot in bustling, picturesque downtown Palo Alto. The ambience of this spot is what really makes
it worth checking out. On the *Share Plates* portion of the menu are the Crispy Hot Chicken Sliders. The sliders consist
of small pieces of crispy fried chicken coated in a Cajun-style hot sauce (think Crystal hot sauce), kale-cabbage slaw,
and pickles between toasted Hawaiian rolls. The sandwiches are very vinegary due to the combination of pickles, hot
sauce, and slaw - you either love it or you hate it. Worth trying if spicy and sour is your thing, but we wouldn't
recommend going out of your way to try this.
